# Content-Based Recommendation System

This repository demonstrates a content-based movie recommendation system using movie overviews. The recommendations are generated by calculating cosine similarity between movies based on their descriptions. We use the `TF-IDF` (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) method to vectorize the text data, and then compute cosine similarity to find the most similar movies.

## 1. **Overview**

Content-based recommendation systems suggest items (movies in this case) to users based on the features of the items themselves. For this particular recommendation system, we use the **overview** of each movie to calculate similarities between them.

The recommendation process involves:
1. Creating a **TF-IDF matrix** from the movie overviews.
2. Computing the **cosine similarity** between the movies based on this matrix.
3. Making movie recommendations based on similarity scores.

## 2. **Dataset**

The dataset used is from Kaggleâ€™s [Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset). It includes metadata about movies, such as:

- `title`: The name of the movie.
- `overview`: A short description of the movie's plot.

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file and processed to create a TF-IDF matrix and cosine similarity matrix for movie recommendations.

## 3. **Steps to Implement**

### 1. **Create TF-IDF Matrix**
   - A `TF-IDF` matrix is created using the `TfidfVectorizer` from `sklearn`. This matrix helps convert the text (movie overview) into numerical vectors, where the importance of each word is considered based on its frequency and inverse document frequency.

### 2. **Calculate Cosine Similarity**
   - The `cosine_similarity` function is used to calculate the similarity between all pairs of movies based on the TF-IDF matrix. The cosine similarity value ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 means the movies are exactly the same and 0 means they have no similarity.

### 3. **Make Recommendations**
   - Based on the cosine similarity matrix, a list of movies similar to a given movie title is generated by comparing the similarity scores. The top 10 most similar movies are recommended.

### 4. **Recommendation Function**
   - A function `content_based_recommender` is created to find the top 10 similar movies to any movie title provided by the user.
